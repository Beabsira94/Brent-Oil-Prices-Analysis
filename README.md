# Analyzing Key Influences on Brent Oil Prices Using Time Series Models

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the influence of major political and economic events on Brent oil prices over the past decade. As a data scientist at Birhan Energies, my goal is to develop a model that assesses how factors such as OPEC policy changes, international sanctions, and conflicts in oil-producing regions impact oil price volatility. By exploring these effects, the project aims to provide strategic insights for investors, policymakers, and energy companies navigating the complex oil market.

## Project Objectives

To accurately model the drivers behind Brent oil price changes, the project involves a structured analysis process. Initial tasks focused on defining a detailed workflow to analyze oil price trends effectively. This included an in-depth understanding of data sources, sampling intervals, and the role of key assumptions, allowing for a clear set of expected outputs and identifying model limitations. Through this structured approach, the analysis is positioned to yield insights that are both accessible and practical for stakeholders across sectors.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Data Analysis Workflow**To create a cohesive workflow, I mapped out each step involved in the data analysis, focusing on ensuring data quality, relevancy, and collection methodology. This task helped establish the foundational structure of the analysis, ensuring clarity in both the anticipated data inputs and the eventual outputs.
2. **Model Selection and Understanding**I conducted research on time series models ideal for capturing oil price fluctuations, specifically ARIMA and GARCH, and investigated additional approaches like Markov-Switching ARIMA and machine learning models such as LSTM. This study informed how these models could capture distinct political and economic influences on oil prices and helped identify critical variables needed for the model.
3. **Environment Setup**
   I structured the project workspace on GitHub, organizing essential files, documentation, and datasets. This setup not only ensures efficient project management and version control but also supports future code implementations, streamlining collaboration and progress tracking.

## Future Work

1. **Advanced Modeling**The next phase involves in-depth modeling of historical Brent oil prices using techniques like Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Markov-Switching ARIMA to improve accuracy. Further, incorporating machine learning models, including LSTM networks, will allow for the capture of complex dependencies. Additional analysis will explore macroeconomic indicators and geopolitical factors such as GDP and exchange rates, offering a more comprehensive view of oil price dynamics.
2. **Dashboard Development**
   To make the results actionable and accessible, I plan to develop an interactive dashboard using Flask and React. This dashboard will display key metrics, allowing stakeholders to filter data by event-driven spikes, explore changes over specific timeframes, and review performance metrics. This will provide a user-friendly experience for visualizing insights in real-time.

## Conclusion

This project has set a robust foundation for understanding Brent oil price influences through a structured workflow, targeted model selection, and a streamlined project environment. As I move forward, I aim to apply advanced models, refine data-driven insights, and present findings in an interactive format that will empower stakeholders to better comprehend the factors shaping oil prices.
